# path-finding-visualizer

A visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms in binary matrices.

This project is currently **WIP**. It will get more updates as time passes.

## Algorithms
These are currently available algorithms:
- **Breadth-first Algorithm**: unweighted, nice, guarantees the shortest path.
- **Depth-first Algorithm**: unweighted, bad, does not guarantee the shortest path.

## Contributions
If you have found any issues, or ideas for improvement; feel free to open an issue or a pull request! All contributions are welcome!

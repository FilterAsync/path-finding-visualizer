# react-shortest-path

## NOTE
This project is not yet fully completed. By the mean of the word "visualization," I have made an *extended* version in the `extended` branch. I will keep this current branch as long as the extended one gets completed.

## What is this?

A web app that utilizes the Breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. Developed using React.js framework. You can see it [here](https://filterasync.github.io/react-shortest-path).

The source code can be freely modified, copied, and distributed, so long as you leave credits to the authors.

## Usage

Enter a valid matrix in the matrix field, and specify source and destination. Make sure that both source and destination are valid:
- The coordination of both source and destination is not an *obstacle*.
- Source and destination must be *reachable*.

Afterward, click the button `Perform BFS`; it will show you the shortest path between these two. The coordinates highlighted in yellow are the shortest path vertex.

## Issues & Improvements

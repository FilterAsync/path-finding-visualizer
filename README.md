# react-shortest-path

## What is this?

A web app that utilizes the Breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices. Developed using React.js framework.

You can see it [here](https://filterasync.github.io/react-shortest-path).

## Usage

Enter a valid matrix in the matrix field, and specify source and destination. Make sure that both source and destination are valid:
- The coordination of both source and destination is not an *obstacle*.
- Source and destination must be *reachable*.

Afterward, click the button `Perform BFS`; it will show you the shortest path between these two. The coordinates highlighted in yellow are the shortest path vertex.
